# Classification_Gissete_dataset
 Measuring the accuracy of Naïve Bayes and Neural Networks classifiers before and after dimensionality reduction on Gisette dataset

"Code_1.ipynb” is developed using scikit-learn MLP and Naive Bayes classifiers.

“Code_2.ipynb” is developed using Keras Neural Nets and scikit-learn Naive Bayes classifiers.

“Expained_Variance_Ratio.ipynb” contains a plot using plotly in order to build an interactive visual.

Enjoy :)
